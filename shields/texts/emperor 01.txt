20 tokens in reserve

Basic Powers
------------
Prison Planet:
You may revive up to 1 token for free.

Great Wealth:
You may give spice to allies at any time in the turn.
This does not allow you to pay their costs, nor reduce their costs in any way.

Golden Lion Throne:
Payment for treachery cards go to you directly (even if you gave them spice!).
When you purchase treachery cards, you pay the bank.

Advanced Powers

Combat Medics:
You may play a Karama card at any time to revive up to 3 Army tokens or 1 Leader for free.
These tokens go directly to your reserves and do not count against your normal revival limits.
Only 1 token may be a Sardaukar.

==> NOTE:  This is an optional rule that we've never played!
